                <p>A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate. Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter. When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars. Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for. 

                    It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game. </p>
