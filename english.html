                <p>A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate. Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter. When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars. Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for. 

                    It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game. </p>

                <h4>Marcel</h4>
                <p>"Nice day out! As a parent, it's all about having the Commodore 64 floppies in your hands or doing some old-fashioned duck hunting, but then also just ending up on the PS5 and playing all the arcade games from the past with your child in the meantime. Wow, what memories you can tangibly transfer to your child here as a parent. Really a must do!
                    4 stars because it was too short due to corona and the catering industry is worthlessly limited. Otherwise 6 stars." </p>
                <h4>Bouke Groenescheij</h4>
                <p>"Yes, this is really cool for a game enthusiast. The nostalgic atmosphere, the layout of certain corners, the enormous arcade hall. Pretty cool! Highly recommended if you are in the area. We had a slot with 1.5 hours left, but we could easily have enjoyed ourselves longer."</p>
                <H4>Rachella Rietdijk</H4>
                <P>"Very nice to go here with your kids! So many games you can play. Very old or new! We thought 2 hours was enough, but if you like gaming you can also hang around here all day."</P>
